# Panic-Button-App

An app that allows the user to send their own GPS location to an emergency contact via text message. Allows the user to choose their emergency contact from their contact list and send their latitude, longitude and current address via text message	Extra functionality of being able to place a call to the emergency contact when the button is pressed. Great tool for children and seniors
